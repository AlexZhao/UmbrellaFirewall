# UmbrellaFirewall

CAUTION FreeBSD based not working on Linux   

This is a home used router which based on TrueNAS, TrueNAS is ZFS based NAS server which I'd like to use ZFS natively than direct on Linux    

# Firewall on TrueNAS(FreeBSD)   

ipfw based firewall configuration which will block many different types of traffic    
it based on the ideas that it only open the access when you really need it by lookup the domain name from internal network   
The open access agent is working DMZ(Linux) server


# This is a tool used for access network for technology and science only do not use it for bad things
